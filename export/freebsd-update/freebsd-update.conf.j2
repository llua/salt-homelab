# Directory in which to store downloaded updates and temporary
# files used by FreeBSD Update.
# WorkDir /var/db/freebsd-update

# MailTo root

# Is FreeBSD Update allowed to create new files?
# AllowAdd yes

# Is FreeBSD Update allowed to delete files?
# AllowDelete yes

# If the user has modified file ownership, permissions, or flags, should
# FreeBSD Update retain this modified metadata when installing a new version
# of that file?
# KeepModifiedMetadata yes

# When upgrading between releases, should the list of Components be
# read strictly (StrictComponents yes) or merely as a list of components
# which *might* be installed of which FreeBSD Update should figure out
# which actually are installed and upgrade those (StrictComponents no)?
# StrictComponents no

# When installing a new kernel perform a backup of the old one first
# so it is possible to boot the old kernel in case of problems.
# BackupKernel yes

# If BackupKernel is enabled, the backup kernel is saved to this
# directory.
# BackupKernelDir /boot/kernel.old

# When backing up a kernel also back up debug symbol files?
